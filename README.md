# Svachat chat widget
Welcome to our first open source project! Please be aware that we are not experienced in managing open source projects, and for that reason
we need your help! This widget is intended to be a Vue.js app that could be embbeded in any website with just a JS/HTML/CSS file. We will
publish more details whenever we can! Meanwhile, feel free to give any feedback you want by opening issues.
